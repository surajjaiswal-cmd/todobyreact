In this to-do app, you can store your data until you choose to delete it. We use localStorage to save data permanently.
Each function is encapsulated in its own component to make the code easier to understand.
To avoid prop drilling, we have used Redux Toolkit and created a separate slice for each state. This makes the app much easier to understand and manage.
